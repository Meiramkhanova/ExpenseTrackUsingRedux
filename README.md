What was used to enhance the functionality and UI of a project: Redux for State management, React-Router-Dom for routing, Styled Components for styling, uuid for unique ID generating. 
I have 3 actions and based on this in reducers written functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting. Added middleware for async fetching and logging redux. Also has functionality for search filtering
